package.skeleton("testpkg")

load_all("testpkg")

## edit .Rd files to have a title, then build with installed Rtools
##  and R in path etc., otherwise this fails on missing/empty "Rd files must have a non-empty \title."

build("testpkg", binary = TRUE)

## to use winbuilder (but this fails on FTP for me)
build_win("testpkg")

## installs and reloads (test by changing fun1 definition and DESCRIPTION)
install("testpkg")
